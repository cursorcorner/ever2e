-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the application, activate the "ever2e" executable.

Emulated disk support is not yet implemented, but pre-generated files can be
loaded into the emulator at startup by setting "ever2e.exe" as the default
application used to open ".bas" files and then double clicking on the desired
program.

A few sample programs are included with the application.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DHIRES bits should start scanning 7 pixels before HIRES bits. Could add an
8-pixel border around a 567x384 screen to make 583x400 windowed mode and
640x480 in full screen mode. This shift would eliminate the need for an
alternate DHIRES palette and more accurately represents the expected IIe
behavior.

The color palette is slightly off. Greys, white, and 3-bit pastel colors should
all have twice the intensity of 1 and 2-bit colors.

If you press escape to exit F1 menu, first character of input is not deleted
for ever2e testinput.txt file. If you press F1, it is. Extra space inserted
for now as temporary solution.

Should put a freeze on keyboard input while automated input is being processed.

The following crashes the program: F1 toggle while executing BASIC program.
This is likely because the CPU state is not yet saved properly.

Add save state

CPU bug - "HPLOT [x1], [y1] to [x2], [y2]" does not function correctly.

Emulator does not pass memory test when ctrl-closed-apple-reset (ctrl-right-
alt-F12) is pressed.

Sound clips every few seconds possibly due to rounding error of elapsed time.
Syncing the previous and next sound buffers may remedy this.

Working directory is lost when ever2e is indirectly called, causing the icon
to disappear and other potential side-effects. This can be fixed by reading
arg[0] and determining working directory (default "./").

Decimal mode not yet implemented in CPU.

Minor - Open and closed apple keys can not be pressed at the same time.

Minor - Initial state of caps-lock key is unknown.

Minor - Pause does not display screen correctly in multi-monitor state
such as the one seen in "test_split.bas". To fix this, either keep a copy of
the last drawn screen (slow) or just a copy of the last 7680 states used to
draw the screen (16k-32k overhead vs 8k overhead 60 times per second). The
upside of using the screen buffer approach is that it scales to a resizable-
window blit method. Alternatively a copy could only be made upon pausing the
screen and the screen refresh method could simply reprint it. All other calls
to refresh could be ignored since otherwise the screen is constantly updated.

Minor - CPU speed modifies video sync timing applications - should draw
every nth frame n times faster to avoid this problem. Use "test_split.bas"
for an example of the bug (which is actually also a problem with hardware
speed enhancements on the Apple IIe).

Minor - The speaker tick waveform is very closely matched by the emulator, but
to get a more precise static pattern of an Apple IIe may require recording a
single speaker toggle in both directions. The static pattern is surprisingly
stable between toggles. More research has also shown that the toggle air-
pressure should be higher when switching from the relaxed to tense diaphragm
state. The air-pressure physics calculation may be slightly off as well. It is
currently modeled after spring physics.
